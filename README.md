# What is this?

This project is a conformable setup to work with `three.js` and `rxjs` in an `angular` environment and philosophy.
You also can hook it up with `OSC` via the websocket server (`osc-server/bridge.js`).

This allows you to build audio visualisations with the help of `OSC`, `three.js` and `rxjs` using a very **productive** workflow.


Boilerplate angular README:

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## OSC ([Open Sound Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control?oldformat=true)) server

Run `osc-server/bridge.js`. Needed only for `OSC` functionality. Remember to install the
dependencies before running.

## Build production

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
